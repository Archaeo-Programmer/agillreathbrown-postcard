I am a computational archaeologist interested in how individuals and groups respond to both large scale processes such as climate change and local processes such as violence and wealth inequality. I also have an interest in tattoo archaeology, particularly in the southwestern United States. I developed a deeper curiosity in the subject after discovering the oldest tattoo tool in Western North America National Geographic.
